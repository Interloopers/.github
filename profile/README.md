## 🌟 **Who We Are**
Welcome to **Interloopers**, a team of passionate game developers who love to innovate, collaborate, and create engaging gaming experiences. Formed out of the need to streamline our work and display our game development projects, we built this organization to house our winning creations and future endeavors. 🎯

## 🏆 **Our Story**
It all started with a mission to showcase our work. After winning **Cognition Game Jam ‘24** with our game **Bloodstained Doofestien**, we realized that each member maintaining separate repositories was inefficient. To solve this, we created **Interloopers**, where all our projects live under one roof 🏠. Now, our projects are pinned to our profiles, and we can focus on what we do best: making games! 🎮

## 🚀 **Our Mission**
We built **Interloopers** to:
- 🛠️ Centralize all our team’s repositories and work.
- ⏳ Save time from managing individual repos.
- 🔥 Collaborate more effectively as a team.
- 🎯 Showcase our game development journey and growth. 

**Interloopers** isn’t about expanding the team; it’s about perfecting the craft of game development. Whether it’s a jam, a hackathon, or just another creative endeavor, our projects will always have a home here. 🏠

## 🏅 **Achievements**
- **Bloodstained Doofestien**: 🥇 *1st Place* - **Cognition Game Jam ‘24**  
  Our doom-like FPS game with fast-paced action and simplistic gameplay led us to victory.
  
- **The Legend of Valhalla**: *Top 12 Finalist* - **Cognition Hackathon Qualifiers**  
  A rich action-adventure game set in the world of Norse mythology that captured the hearts of the audience.

## 🎮 **What’s Next?**
We’re just getting started! As we continue to participate in more hackathons and game jams, this organization will grow with more projects, more ideas, and more creative solutions. Our mission is to keep innovating, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what games can be.

Stay tuned for our next big thing! 🎯
