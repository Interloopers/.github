**Web Development Enthusiasts | Hackathon Participants**

## 🌟 **About Us**  
We are **Interloopers**, a team primarily focused on **web development** but always up for a challenge! While our roots are in creating dynamic, innovative web solutions, we also dabble in hackathons to explore new horizons.

Initially, each team member hosted their own repositories for various projects, which quickly became time-consuming to manage. To streamline this, we created this organization to **consolidate all our work** under one roof. No more scattered repos — everything now lives here, pinned and easily accessible on our profiles!

While web development remains our core focus, one of our proudest achievements is winning **1st place in the Cognition Game Jam ‘24** with our game **Bloodstained Doofestien**. We don't usually develop games, but we love to dive into new challenges and problem-solving, and this was a great experience.

## 🛠️ **What We Do**  
- **Web Development**: Our bread and butter. Whether it's front-end design, back-end functionality, or full-stack projects, we've got it covered.
- **Hackathons**: We regularly participate in hackathons to push our boundaries and apply our skills in new and exciting ways.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Working together is what we do best, creating streamlined workflows to manage and complete our projects efficiently.

## 🎮 **Why Interloopers?**  
The team was formed out of necessity: managing multiple individual repositories for group projects was inefficient and messy. Now, **Interloopers** serves as a hub for all our collaborative projects. We have no plans to expand the team — this is strictly an internal solution to **make project management easier**.

## 🚀 **Our Work So Far**  
- **Bloodstained Doofestien**: The game that won us 1st place at **Cognition Game Jam '24**! A rare venture into game development.
- **The Legend of Valhalla**: An action-adventure game that helped us qualify for the **Cognition Game Jam**, a true team effort that paid off.

You’ll find our work on GitHub under this organization, and we’re excited to **keep growing** our repository with more **web development** and **hackathon** projects. Stay tuned for future updates as we continue to explore, build, and develop!

## 🌐 **Looking Forward**  
Expect more **web projects** and **hackathon** entries to come. Though game development is not our main gig, we’ll always rise to the challenge when it counts. Keep an eye out for what’s next!
