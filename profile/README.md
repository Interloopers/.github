# 🌐 **Interloopers** 

**Collaborative Creators | Hackathon Innovators**

Welcome to **Interloopers**—an organization founded out of necessity to streamline our project management process. Initially, each team member was creating individual repositories for collaborative projects, which quickly became inefficient. To solve this, we created **Interloopers**, where all our projects now reside, giving us a unified space to showcase our work.

## 🛠️ **Who We Are**

We are a team passionate about **web development** and enjoy pushing our skills further through **hackathons**. Although we made waves by winning a **game jam**, web development is where our hearts (and code) lie. This organization serves as a testament to our journey through various hackathons and the creative solutions we build along the way.

## 📌 **Our Work So Far**  

- **Bloodstained Doofestien**: Our first-place project at **Cognition Game Jam '24**, a Doom-inspired game where players face waves of enemies in a simplistic environment. This project helped us get selected among the top 12 teams from 64 in the qualifiers.
- **The Legend of Valhalla**: An action-adventure game created during another thrilling game jam. With unique combat and upgrade mechanics, this project gave us great exposure and experience.
  
Our main focus remains **web development**, and these game projects were one-off entries into the game development world through hackathons.

## 🚀 **Looking Ahead**

We will continue participating in hackathons and pushing the boundaries of web development. Expect more exciting projects to be added here in the future!

> *Note: While we appreciate interest, we aren’t looking to expand our team at the moment, as this organization was created to streamline collaboration among existing members.*

## 💡 **Why We Created Interloopers**

Managing separate repositories across multiple profiles became a hassle. By consolidating everything under one organization, we now have a single space to showcase our collaborative work. Each of us pins the relevant repositories in our profiles, making it easier to navigate and present our contributions.
