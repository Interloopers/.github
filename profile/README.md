#🌀 **Interloopers** 🌀

**Hackathon Heroes | Web Wizards**

Welcome to **Interloopers**—where we figured out that juggling individual repos was just too much! 🎉 We came together to create a space for our projects, and guess what? We even snagged 1st place at the Cognition Game Jam! 🏆 

We're primarily web developers, but we love jumping into game jams for fun. Check out our projects and join us in our hackathon adventures! 



## 🛠️ **Who We Are**

We are a team passionate about **web development** and enjoy pushing our skills further through **hackathons**. Although we made waves by winning a **game jam**, web development is where our hearts (and code) lie. This organization serves as a testament to our journey through various hackathons and the creative solutions we build along the way.

## 📌 **Our Work So Far**  

- 🩸 [Bloodstained Doofestien](https://github.com/Interloopers/Bloodstained-Doofestien): Our first-place project at **Cognition Game Jam '24**, a Doom-inspired game where players face waves of enemies in a simplistic environment. This project helped us get selected among the top 12 teams from 64 in the qualifiers.
- ⚔️ [The Legend of Valhalla](https://github.com/Interloopers/The-Legend-of-Valhalla): An action-adventure game created during another thrilling game jam. With unique combat and upgrade mechanics, this project gave us great exposure and experience.
  
Our main focus remains **web development**, and these game projects were one-off entries into the game development world through hackathons.

## 🚀 **Looking Ahead**

We will continue participating in hackathons and pushing the boundaries of web development. Expect more exciting projects to be added here in the future!

> *Note: While we appreciate interest, we aren’t looking to expand our team at the moment, as this organization was created to streamline collaboration among existing members.*

## 💡 **Why We Created Interloopers**

Managing separate repositories across multiple profiles became a hassle. By consolidating everything under one organization, we now have a single space to showcase our collaborative work. Each of us pins the relevant repositories in our profiles, making it easier to navigate and present our contributions.
